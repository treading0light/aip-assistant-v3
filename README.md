# AIP Assistant

This app is designed to help someone who has chosen to practice an Auto Immune Protocol diet. An AIP diet starts with an elimination of most ingredients, leaving you with a very small selection. As time progresses you will go through stages of introducing different ingredients, waiting to see if there is a reaction, remove or add permanently the ingredient to your acceptable list, and repeat. This app lets you add ingredients to your profile, and then browse recipes that only include your acceptable ingredients.
